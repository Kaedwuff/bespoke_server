	description = "This species of reptilian humanoids evolved on a heat-blasted planet where surface water was scarce outside of polar regions. As a result, they are well-adapted to hot enviroments with limited water, but struggle in colder climates. \
	Despite the fact that these creatures are sensitive to cold, they are excellent survivors and difficult to take down or fight."
